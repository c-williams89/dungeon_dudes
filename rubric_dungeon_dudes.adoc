== Dungeon Dudes


In Pylandia's quaint village of Codeville, tales of brave knights and fearsome monsters are whispered in hushed tones around crackling campfires. Recently, the villagers have taken to a new form of entertainment - a text-based RPG called "Dungeon Dudes". Yet, as the game gained popularity, they realized something was amiss. The game lacked depth in its characters and monsters, and the villagers were yearning for more.

Enter the budding programmers of Codeville Academy! They've been tasked with breathing life into the game. 

* Each student will design their own '**Character**' or '**Monster**' module
** ensuring that their creation fits seamlessly into the existing world of "Dungeon Dudes". 
* Along the way, they will sharpen their skills in **Object-Oriented Programming**, 
* learn to **integrate their work into an established codebase**
* and master the art of **git collaboration**.

The villagers of Codeville have high hopes. Now, they eagerly await the adventures that the new "Dungeon Dudes" will bring. Just remember, young coders, in Codeville, it's not just about writing code - it's about creating legends! So, gear up and dive into the dungeons. The world of "Dungeon Dudes" awaits your magic touch!
